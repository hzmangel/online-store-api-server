# online-store-api-server

In the past days, I have worked out some online shopping sites (unfortunately, most of them are dead...), and I have collected some requirements and my implementations. The purpose of this project is used to save my past experiences and future time.

The original projects are mostly implemented via Ruby on Rails and Nodejs, but I want to try Golang in this project.

## Features Included

The project is used for selling goods, which will contains those functions/modules:

* Products, including category, spec, SKU, selling area.
* Orders
* Customers/Sellers
* TBD
